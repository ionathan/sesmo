<p class="message" markdown="1">
All papers must be submitted via the [Easychair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isess2020).

Papers varying in scope of their contribution are accepted for presentation at ISESS, following peer-review by at least two independent reviewers - members of the Program Committee.
All papers should be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference and clearly state their contribution(s) in the abstract and paper. 

We are invite two types of papers:

- Full Papers are expected to be 8-12 pages; 
- Short Papers are expected to be 4-6 pages.


All submissions should be formatted following the publisher's [instructions](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). There are both Word and Latex templates for preparing your paper.  LaTeX templates are also available in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WsdHOy5uZpg).

Accepted papers will be published with Springer as chapters in volume 554 of [IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology](https://www.springer.com/series/6102?detailsPage=titles) series.

Authors of accepted papers are expected to register for the conference and consent to publish their paper with Springer. There are options for Open-Access publishing of individual papers at additional cost. Contact the organizers if interested.
