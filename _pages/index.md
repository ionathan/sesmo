ISESS, the International Symposium on Environmental Software Systems, was initiated in 1995 as a forum to present and discuss research fundamentals and state-of-the-art applications in environmental informatics. 
Over the years, it has also evolved into an important networking event for academics and industry experts, specializing in software engineering, data science and environmental sciences.


The 13th International Symposium on Environmental Software Systems (ISESS'2020) theme is **Data Science in Action**, and 
aims to serve as a forum to present primary research in data science research and applications in the environmental and green life sciences. 

ISESS 2020 is organised by the [Wageningen Data Competence Centre](https://www.wur.nl/en/Value-Creation-Cooperation/WDCC.htm) and will be hosted at [Wageningen University & Research](http://www.wur.nl) campus, in Wageningen, Netherlands.


## About ISESS

ISESS brings together researchers dealing with environmental challenges and trying to provide solutions using forward-looking and leading-edge IT technology. The conference connects acadamia and industry to overcome a manifold of technology changes and dynamics by using their best knowledge to improve our environment, and therefore the well-being of our society.

ISESS is a conference series organized on behalf of the [International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), Working Group 5.11 “Computers and Environment”](http://www.ifip.org).
Previous editions of the conference have been held in 
Zadar, Croatia ([ISESS'2017](isess2017/)), 
Melbourne, Australia ([ISESS'2015)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-15994-2), and 
Neusiedl am See, Austria ([ISESS'2013](isess2013/)).

Since 2011, the Symposium Proceedings have been published as Springer books, under the IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology (AICT) series, and are available online.
Check out the [ISESS 2017 proceedings at Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-89935-0). 

Springer reported approximately 100.000 articles downloads of our proceedings series. In addition, [enviromatics.org](http://www.enviromatics.org) contains a complete record of all ISESS proceedings since 1995.

## Wageningen Data Science Week

The Symposium is organized as part of a broader event: The Wageningen Data Science Week. During this week, attention will be given to requirements and potential advances in data science applied to in environmental science in various events. Education, Data management, Infrastructure, and Value creation will be discussed and investigated in crash courses, a hackathon, workshops, a movie, and meetups are in the agenda. ISESS Conference participants are welcome to join the Wageningen Data Science Week.
